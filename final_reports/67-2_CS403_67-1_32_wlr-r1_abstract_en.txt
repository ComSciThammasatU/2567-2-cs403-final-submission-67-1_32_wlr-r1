THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEBIAN-BASED AUTOMATION WEB SERVER VULNERABILITY SCANNER NET-TOOL
Information and data security is a top priority for organizations, especially as the usage of information technology resources grows significantly. This growth has resulted in more cyberattacks and vulnerability within the fields. As a result, penetration testing has become a crucial procedure for investigating, assessing, analyzing, and fixing these vulnerabilities. Manual penetration testing frequently requires the knowledge of vulnerability assessment specialists. As the number of vulnerabilities increases, organizations must dedicate considerable staff, resources, budgets, and time to each operation. This project applies extensive penetration testing standards to automated systems with the goal of developing an automated tool to improve penetration testing efficiency. It aims to streamline operations, reduce human interaction and human error, and allow for repetitive tests without requiring fresh resource preparation from the ground.
